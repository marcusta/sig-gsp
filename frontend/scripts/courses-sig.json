If you live in the area, I think that every course in the system is worth exploring.\r\n\r\n\r\nAn aerial view of Glen Oaks\r\nGlen Oaks is a typical Michigan parklands course. It has a nice mix of open and tree-lined fairways, a portion of the Rouge River that meanders through the layout and spots of marshland. Built on 122 acres, Glen Oaks has a back-and-forth design, but didn’t feel too cramped to me. The course opened in 1930.\r\n\r\nBogey golfers will find Glen Oaks a friendly place. A par 70, Glen Oaks stretches to 6, 051 yards from the back tees. It plays to a 69.7/126. A tee up, it comes in at 5, 714 and a 64.1/110. I normally caution players to move up a tee, but in this case, the back tees likely will suffice.","opcdName":"GlenOaks_gsp","opcdVersion":"v3","addedDate":"2024-10-27T13:32:26.265Z","updatedDate":"2023-05-01T06:13:46.000Z","sgtId":"460","sgtSplashUrl":"","sgtYoutubeUrl":"https://youtube.com/embed/tBoHChFlfkw","par":70,"isPar3":false,"teeBoxes":[{"id":2285,"courseId":381,"name":"Black","rating":126,"slope":69.7,"length":5490.364},{"id":2286,"courseId":381,"name":"White","rating":125,"slope":68.1,"length":5197.293},{"id":2287,"courseId":381,"name":"Green","rating":110,"slope":64.1,"length":4433.73975},{"id":2288,"courseId":381,"name":"Yellow","rating":105,"slope":62.4,"length":4113.863},{"id":2289,"courseId":381,"name":"Junior","rating":155,"slope":80,"length":3623.7583},{"id":2290,"courseId":381,"name":"Par3","rating":120,"slope":54,"length":2585.94287}],"tags":[]},{"id":382,"name":"Glens Falls Country Club","alternateName":"","location":"Queensbury, NY","country":"Queensbury, NY","holes":18,"altitude":394,"grade":3,"designer":"Tekbud","difficulty":3,"graphics":3,"golfQuality":3,"description":"The Glens Falls Country Club is a private, member-owned country club with over 400 members, located in Queensbury, NY.\r\nThe club is filled with a rich history and fond memories.

In doing so, Dye re-introduced deception, misdirection and railroad ties into American golf architecture. Its construction attracted the attention of local boy Jack Nicklaus, who visited several times and made some astute suggestions. That led to a five-year Dye-Nicklaus design partnership. The Golf Club remained untouched for nearly 45 years, until 2014, when Pete Dye returned to rebuild holes, modestly adjusting some of his original green contours to better match them to present-day green speeds. He also relocated the fifth green, adding a contorted putting surface more reminiscent of his later designs, an inconspicuous reminder how much his design pedilictions evolved throughout his career.\r","opcdName":"golf_club_ohio_gsp","opcdVersion":"v4","addedDate":"2024-10-27T13:33:10.273Z","updatedDate":"2023-08-20T14:04:52.000Z","sgtId":"1020","sgtSplashUrl":"/public/assets/courseImages/splashes/splash_1020.jpg","sgtYoutubeUrl":"https://youtube.com/embed/k3CGqgPAhow","par":72,"isPar3":false,"teeBoxes":[{"id":2378,"courseId":396,"name":"Black","rating":127,"slope":67.2,"length":5077.07129},{"id":2379,"courseId":396,"name":"White","rating":136,"slope":73.5,"length":6288.25146},{"id":2380,"courseId":396,"name":"Blue","rating":142,"slope":75.9,"length":6808.911},{"id":2381,"courseId":396,"name":"Yellow","rating":136,"slope":71.9,"length":5932.893},{"id":2382,"courseId":396,"name":"Red","rating":131,"slope":69.6,"length":5539.62939},{"id":2383,"courseId":396,"name":"Junior","rating":120,"slope":72,"length":3361.22974},{"id":2384,"courseId":396,"name":"Par3","rating":120,"slope":54,"length":2310.94946}],"tags":[]},{"id":397,"name":"Goose River Golf Club","alternateName":"","location":"Rockport, ME","country":"Rockport, ME","holes":9,"altitude":108,"grade":3,"designer":"Thegolfboy","difficulty":3,"graphics":3,"golfQuality":3,"description":"","opcdName":"goose_river_v1_gsp","opcdVersion":"v3","addedDate":"2024-10-27T13:33:14.842Z","updatedDate":"2022-12-08T11:48:06.000Z","sgtId":"683","sgtSplashUrl":"/public/assets/courseImages/splashes/splash_683.jpg","sgtYoutubeUrl":"https://youtube.com/embed/hyUU72giXdE","par":35,"isPar3":false,"teeBoxes":[{"id":2385,"courseId":397,"name":"White","rating":0,"slope":0,"length":2398.6936},{"id":2386,"courseId":397,"name":"Blue","rating":0,"slope":0,"length":2816.43555},{"id":2387,"courseId":397,"name":"Red","rating":0,"slope":0,"length":2321.87061}],"tags":[]},{"id":398,"name":"Gordon Lakes Island View - Lake View","alternateName":"","location":"Fort Gordon, GA","country":"Fort Gordon, GA","holes":18,"altitude":325,"grade":3,"designer":"Thegolfboy","difficulty":3,"graphics":3,"golfQuality":3,"description":"","opcdName":"gordonlakes_island_lake_gsp","opcdVersion":"v3","addedDate":"2024-10-27T13:33:15.934Z","updatedDate":"2023-01-10T14:46:18.000Z","sgtId":"726","sgtSplashUrl":"/public/assets/courseImages/splashes/splash_726.jpg","sgtYoutubeUrl":"https://youtube.com/embed/GaMk5D4rTaw","par":72,"isPar3":false,"teeBoxes":[{"id":2388,"courseId":398,"name":"Black","rating":0,"slope":0,"length":6380.06641},{"id":2389,"courseId":398,"name":"White","rating":0,"slope":0,"length":5872.12744},{"id":2390,"courseId":398,"name":"Blue","rating":0,"slope":0,"length":6156.375},{"id":2391,"courseId":398,"name":"Yellow","rating":0,"slope":0,"length":5472.82666},{"id":2392,"courseId":398,"name":"Red","rating":0,"slope":0,"length":4872.1665},{"id":2393,"courseId":398,"name":"Junior","rating":0,"slope":0,"length":3415.29956},{"id":2394,"courseId":398,"name":"Par3","rating":0,"slope":0,"length":2429.46558}],"tags":[]},{"id":399,"name":"Gordon Lakes Island View - Pine View","alternateName":"","location":"Fort Gordon, GA","country":"Fort Gordon, GA","holes":18,"altitude":325,"grade":3,"designer":"Thegolfboy","difficulty":3,"graphics":3,"golfQuality":3,"description":"","opcdName":"gordonlakes_island_pine","opcdVersion":"v3","addedDate":"2024-10-27T13:33:18.455Z","updatedDate":"2023-01-09T09:24:48.000Z","sgtId":"727","sgtSplashUrl":"/public/assets/courseImages/splashes/splash_727.jpg","sgtYoutubeUrl":"","par":72,"isPar3":false,"teeBoxes":[{"id":2395,"courseId":399,"name":"Black","rating":0,"slope":0,"length":6324.86963},{"id":2396,"courseId":399,"name":"White","rating":0,"slope":0,"length":5769.188},{"id":2397,"courseId":399,"name":"Blue","rating":0,"slope":0,"length":6071.646},{"id":2398,"courseId":399,"name":"Yellow","rating":0,"slope":0,"length":5371.164},{"id":2399,"courseId":399,"name":"Red","rating":0,"slope":0,"length":4961.1123},{"id":2400,"courseId":399,"name":"Junior","rating":0,"slope":0,"length":3510.40332},{"id":2401,"courseId":399,"name":"Par3","rating":0,"slope":0,"length":2176.3833}],"tags":[]},{"id":400,"name":"Gower","alternateName":"","location":"Swansea, Wales UK","country":"Swansea, Wales UK","holes":18,"altitude":0,"grade":3,"designer":"Dicky1eye","difficulty":3,"graphics":3,"golfQuality":3,"description":"The Gower Golf Club was formed in 1995, by founders John and Olwen Richards.

It is here that the game of golf, and the golf experience, is being raised to a higher level available anywhere in the region. In terms of course design, natural beauty, location, and family-friendly atmosphere, Vermont National Country Club defines the new standard in New England.\r\n\r\nThe club's centerpiece is the Jack Nicklaus and Jack Nicklaus II Signature designed championship course that continues the legendary Nicklaus tradition of accentuating and amplifying the beauty of the existing natural terrain.\r\n\r\nThe Nicklaus team spent considerable time and effort analyzing Vermont National's 400 acres to devise a course that offers 18 distinct experiences. Throughout the course, you'll be rewarded with panoramic views of the Vermont landscape and spectacular sightlines of towering Mount Mansfield, Camels Hump and the ancient Adirondacks. \r\n\r\nThe Nicklaus Design team developed two distinct design styles for each nine. The front nine of the 7,075-yard, par-72 championship course is more gentle and rolling, with the holes winding through green meadows and quiet valleys. The ambiance, says Jack Nicklaus II, is reminiscent of \"an English or Scottish links kind of feeling.\" The back nine offers a more rugged atmosphere, with dramatic rock outcroppings and ledges creating a craggy backdrop to the stands of sugar maples, butternut and ash trees. The view of Camel's Hump from the 13th & 14th holes is one you'll tell your friends about. The 18th tee, 50 feet up on a ledge, is a vantage point that affords a sweeping view of the Adirondacks looming majestically to the southwest.\r\n\r\nVermont National is first and foremost a course designed for players who love the game, from expert to novice. With six sets of tees, the course ranges from 4,065 yards from the front tees to a full 7,075 yards from the back tees. Nicklaus has made certain that experienced players will continually find interesting challenges, yet the course is designed to have the ultimate playability for those still learning the game. The design assures enjoyable play round after round, while its craftsmanship reveals its intricacies the more you play it.\" - Vermont National Website","opcdName":"VermontNational_GSP","opcdVersion":"v4","addedDate":"2024-11-13T18:16:07.608Z","updatedDate":"2024-11-13T18:16:11.721Z","sgtId":"1971","sgtSplashUrl":"/public/assets/courseImages/splashes/splash_1971.jpg","sgtYoutubeUrl":"","par":72,"isPar3":false,"teeBoxes":[{"id":6833,"courseId":1139,"name":"Black","rating":141,"slope":74,"length":6398.421},{"id":6834,"courseId":1139,"name":"White","rating":127,"slope":67,"length":5090.69971},{"id":6835,"courseId":1139,"name":"Green","rating":114,"slope":64.4,"length":4571.262},{"id":6836,"courseId":1139,"name":"Blue","rating":133,"slope":69.6,"length":5555.661},{"id":6837,"courseId":1139,"name":"Yellow","rating":136,"slope":72.1,"length":5989.70068},{"id":6838,"courseId":1139,"name":"Red","rating":114,"slope":63.6,"length":3770.31836},{"id":6839,"courseId":1139,"name":"Junior","rating":120,"slope":72,"length":1808.27417},{"id":6840,"courseId":1139,"name":"Par3","rating":120,"slope":54,"length":1965.30225}],"tags":[]},{"id":1140,"name":"Vernon Golf Club","alternateName":"","location":"Vernon, TX","country":"Vernon, TX","holes":18,"altitude":1240,"grade":3,"designer":"runpuddrun","difficulty":3,"graphics":3,"golfQuality":3,"description":"The 9-hole \"Hillcrest\" course at the Hillcrest Country Club facility in Vernon, Texas features 3,075 yards of golf from the longest tees for a par of 35.
